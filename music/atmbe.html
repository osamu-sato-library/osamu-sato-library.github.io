<h2>All Things Must Be Equal</h2>

<div class="wiki">
<p>A new album by Osamu Sato, which will be released April 5th in Japan and this June or July internationally. It contains remixes of previous songs and some new material. The vinyl and CD versions (BLN and TYO versions respectively) appear to have slightly different track listings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B06X91L1PF/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_api_E98OybJH80E8W?language=en_US">The CD is available for pre-order from Amazon Japan now!</a> You'll have to make an Amazon Japan account, but they'll ship to you internationally without needing a domestic address.</p>
