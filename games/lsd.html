<h2>LSD: Dream Emulator</h2>

<div class="wiki">
<p>LSD: Dream Emulator is a game developed by OSD, released in Japan in 1998. It was marketed with the catchphrase "this is not a game", and Osamu Sato has described that the goal of the project was using video games an art form. There's no goal, other than to explore the surreal world being presented.</p>
